        <p>The name says it all: this is a hunter who seeks to collect bounties
        for his work. Bounty Hunters tend to be feared, reviled, looked down
        upon - and in great demand throughout the galaxy.</p>

          <p>Considering how often a single Bounty Hunter finds himself faced
          with terrible odds (more often than not an acquisition has friends or
          employees who work hard to protect him), it's not surprising how many
          specialize in high-tech gear and weapons. The Gadgeteer excels a t
          presenting himself a s a one-person battle force, at least for a short
          time. Using both the latest tech and his own personally-modified gear,
          a Bounty Hunter with this specialization can be hard to stop.</p>
