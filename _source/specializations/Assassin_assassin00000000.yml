  description: >-
    <p>Whereas most Bounty Hunters focus primarily on the capture of quarry,
    those who specialize a s Assassins are generally tasked with the
    straightforward proposition of terminating their targets. Assassins tend to
    prefer getting in quietly, taking out targets (either u p close or sniping
    from afar), and leaving just as silently as they entered. Their talents are
    very appropriate for this kind of work.</p><p>Despite their different
    methods. Assassins still adhere to many of the same ethics and practices of
    other Bounty Hunters. They take their work very seriously, avoid all
    needless bloodshed, and honor their contracts t o the letter. Some treat
    their methods with reverence , even assigning a certain mystique to it.
    Others simply see themselves as cold killers, and are just fine with it.</p>
