  description: >-
    <p>Part con artist, part gunslinger, and part cantina brawler. the Scoundrel
    is quick-witted, quick on his feet, and quick to get himself into a great
    deal of trouble at the drop of a hat. He doesn't care one whit for rules or
    laws, except where h e can use them to work an angle that either nets him a
    lot of credits o r brings down an enemy. If he's really lucky-and h e tends
    to have an unshakable faith in his luckâ€”he'll manage both.</p>
