    <p>Considering how often a single Bounty Hunter finds himself faced with
    terrible odds (more often than not an acquisition has friends or employees
    who work hard to protect him), it's not surprising how many specialize in
    high-tech gear and weapons. The Gadgeteer excels a t presenting himself a s
    a one-person battle force, at least for a short time. Using both the latest
    tech and his own personally-modified gear, a Bounty Hunter with this
    specialization can be hard to stop.</p>
